### Tech Stack
## üöó Step 2
 **Azure Databricks** ‚Üí Data ingestion, ETL, and exploratory analysis
## üîê PySpark OAuth Configuration  

Below is a **PySpark script** demonstrating how to set up **OAuth 2.0 authentication** for secure access to **Azure Data Lake** in Databricks.  ![PySpark Authentication Setup] 
```
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.auth.type.<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "OAuth")
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.oauth.provider.type.<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net", 
               "org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.oauth2.ClientCredsTokenProvider")
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id.<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "<client-id>")
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret.<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "<client-secret>")
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint.<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net", "<oauth2-token-endpoint>")
```


The script initializes authentication using **Azure Active Directory**, specifying:  
- **Authentication Type:** OAuth  
- **Provider Type:** Client Credentials Token Provider  
- **Client ID & Secret:** Used for authentication  
- **OAuth Endpoint URL:** Connects to Azure‚Äôs login system  

This ensures that Databricks securely interacts with Azure **without exposing credentials directly** in queries. 
##  Azure Data Lake Access Configuration in Databricks  

Below is a **PySpark configuration snippet**, demonstrating how to set up **Azure Data Lake Storage authentication** in **Databricks**. 

To configure Azure Data Lake access, set the storage account key as follows:

```python
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.key.carsalesreport.dfs.core.windows.net", "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY>")
```

The code initializes Spark settings with the **Azure Storage account key**, enabling secure access to the **carsalesreport Data Lake**. This setup allows Databricks to read and write data stored in Azure efficiently.  
üöó### **üîç Key Configuration Details**  
‚úÖ **Storage Account Key Authentication**: Ensures direct access to Azure Data Lake.  
‚úÖ **Securely Enables Databricks to Read/Write Data**: Critical for large-scale processing in PySpark.  
‚úÖ **Supports Data Pipelines for Synapse SQL & Power BI**: Seamless integration for analytics.

‚úÖ Applies `.option("header", "true")` to ensure headers are correctly recognized.  
‚úÖ Displays the dataset with `.show()`, showcasing key attributes like **Car Model, Price, Transmission Type, and Customer Details**.

## üöó Data Cleaning & Schema Validation  

Before loading data into **Synapse SQL**, we apply **data type conversions** and **encoding corrections** to ensure structured and optimized storage for analysis.  

Below is a **PySpark script** demonstrating essential data cleaning steps before storing the dataset in **Synapse SQL** for analysis.  

![PySpark Data Cleaning]
![Screenshot 2025-06-10 130302](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b0a3d67-c47e-49f7-b6bd-f1876e0353f9)  

### ‚ú® Key Transformations  
- **Date Format Conversion:** Converts string-based dates into a proper `DateType` for optimized filtering.  
- **Encoding Fixes:** Removes unwanted characters from text fields like `Engine`.  
- **Schema Validation:** Confirms correct column data types before database ingestion.  

## üìå Date Format Conversion  
The `Date` column is originally stored as a string (`M/d/yyyy`). Using `to_date()`, we convert it into a **proper DateType** for advanced filtering and sorting. 
## üìå Schema Overview  
Below is the schema of the **PySpark DataFrame** used in this project, displaying column names, data types, and nullability.

## Data Transformation

This section covers the process of transforming raw data using PySpark. After reading the data from Azure Data Lake Storage, you can perform various data cleansing, filtering, and aggregation operations before saving the processed data back to the lake.

Below is an example illustrating how to read the raw data, apply transformations, and configure the connection securely.

---

# Azure Data Lake Storage with PySpark

This example shows how to:

- Initialize a Spark session
- Read data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
- Configure Spark to authenticate using your storage account key

---

## Prerequisites

- Apache Spark installed with PySpark
- Access to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account
- Storage account key (handled securely, **do not** hardcode it in production)

---

## Usage

Replace the placeholder `<your-storage-account-key>` in the code with your actual storage account key. For security, consider using environment variables or Azure Key Vault instead of hardcoding keys.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataLakeWrite").getOrCreate()

# Load your DataFrame (replace path with your actual data location)
df = spark.read.csv(
    "abfss://<container>@<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net/raw-data/",
    header=True,
    inferSchema=True
)

# Define the storage account and container path
storage_account = "<storage-account>"
container = "<container>"
data_path = f"abfss://{container}@{storage_account}.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/your-data-folder"

# Configure authentication with the storage account key
spark.conf.set(
    f"fs.azure.account.key.{storage_account}.dfs.core.windows.net",
    "<your-storage-account-key>"
)

# Write DataFrame to Azure Data Lake Storage
df.write.option("header", 'true').csv(data_path)

print("Data successfully written to Azure Data Lake Storage!")
