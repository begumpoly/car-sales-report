The objective is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that support strategic decisions in the automotive industry. Key focus areas include:

- Identifying top-performing **car models** and **car companies**
- Analyzing the relationship between **pricing**, **customer income**, and **purchasing patterns**
- Performing **gender-based analysis** to understand preferences and behavioral differences
- Comparing sales performance across **car manufacturers** and **regions**
- Detecting **monthly peak sales trends** to identify high-demand periods and seasonal effects
- Enabling **real-time dashboards** for sales, demographics, and market insights

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Azure Databricks**: For data ingestion, transformation (ETL), and exploratory analysis
- **Azure Synapse SQL**: For structured querying and optimized data warehousing
- **Power BI**: For creating dynamic, interactive visualizations and business dashboards
- This project showcases how cloud-based tools can streamline data workflows and deliver deep insights into automotive market trends and customer behavior.

##  Getting Started  

![flowchart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a237644e-0654-4db6-9bf5-c667e3d3739d)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Upload Data**  
- Store raw CSV files in **Azure Blob Storage** or **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Process Data in Databricks**  
- Use **PySpark** or SQL transformations to clean and prepare the data.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Load Data into Synapse SQL**  
- Store cleaned data in **Azure Synapse Analytics** for fast querying.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze and Visualize in Power BI**  
- Connect Synapse SQL to **Power BI dashboards** for real-time insights.  

## üîê PySpark OAuth Configuration  

Below is a **PySpark script** demonstrating how to set up **OAuth 2.0 authentication** for secure access to **Azure Data Lake** in Databricks.  ![PySpark Authentication Setup](path/to/image.png) 
![Screenshot 2025-06-10 103954](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c978ae98-c39f-4e66-9d79-89521f2a09e0)


The script initializes authentication using **Azure Active Directory**, specifying:  
- **Authentication Type:** OAuth  
- **Provider Type:** Client Credentials Token Provider  
- **Client ID & Secret:** Used for authentication  
- **OAuth Endpoint URL:** Connects to Azure‚Äôs login system  

This ensures that Databricks securely interacts with Azure **without exposing credentials directly** in queries. 
##  Azure Data Lake Access Configuration in Databricks  

Below is a **PySpark configuration snippet**, demonstrating how to set up **Azure Data Lake Storage authentication** in **Databricks**.

The code initializes Spark settings with the **Azure Storage account key**, enabling secure access to the **carsalesreport Data Lake**. This setup allows Databricks to read and write data stored in Azure efficiently.  
üöó### **üîç Key Configuration Details**  
‚úÖ **Storage Account Key Authentication**: Ensures direct access to Azure Data Lake.  
‚úÖ **Securely Enables Databricks to Read/Write Data**: Critical for large-scale processing in PySpark.  
‚úÖ **Supports Data Pipelines for Synapse SQL & Power BI**: Seamless integration for analytics.  

## ‚ö° PySpark Data Ingestion from Azure  

Below is a **PySpark script** used to load raw **car sales data** from **Azure Blob Storage** into a DataFrame in **Databricks**.  

![PySpark Data Ingestion](path/to/image.png)  ![Screenshot 2025-06-10 113441](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac7a53f6-cf4e-40f5-8486-888383e1fbb5)  

# üöó Car Sales Data Processing in PySpark

The following script reads a CSV file into **PySpark**, ensuring proper data structure.  

## üîç Code Breakdown  
‚úÖ Uses `spark.read.format("csv")` to load CSV files from Azure Data Lake.  
‚úÖ Applies `.option("header", "true")` to ensure headers are correctly recognized.  
‚úÖ Displays the dataset with `.show()`, showcasing key attributes like **Car Model, Price, Transmission Type, and Customer Details**.

## üöó Data Cleaning & Schema Validation  

Before loading data into **Synapse SQL**, we apply **data type conversions** and **encoding corrections** to ensure structured and optimized storage for analysis.  

Below is a **PySpark script** demonstrating essential data cleaning steps before storing the dataset in **Synapse SQL** for analysis.

### ‚ú® Key Transformations  
- **Date Format Conversion:** Converts string-based dates into a proper `DateType` for optimized filtering.  
- **Encoding Fixes:** Removes unwanted characters from text fields like `Engine`.  
- **Schema Validation:** Confirms correct column data types before database ingestion.  

## üìå Date Format Conversion  
The `Date` column is originally stored as a string (`M/d/yyyy`). Using `to_date()`, we convert it into a **proper DateType** for advanced filtering and sorting. 
## üìå Schema Overview  
Below is the schema of the **PySpark DataFrame** used in this project, displaying column names, data types, and nullability.
